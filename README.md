# Automation

Some portions of the JSON records here are maintained autoamtically by bot service accounts.

* https://github.com/threesigmaxyz/filplus-allocator-bot runs as a github action periodically and syncs multisig signers from chain back to allocator records when they change, and loads in new records of allocations as they occur.
